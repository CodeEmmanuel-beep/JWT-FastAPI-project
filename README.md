# JWT FastAPI project
A beginner-friendly authentication API built with FastAPI and JWT (JSON Web Tokens). This project handles user registration, login, and protected routes using token-based authentication — a common pattern in modern web apps.
Features include but not limited to:
User registration with hashed passwords
Secure login with JWT token generation
Protected routes that require valid tokens
Token expiration and validation
Clean, modular code structure.

Tech Stack
FastAPI – for building the API
Pydantic – for data validation
JWT (PyJWT or jose) – for token-based authentication
SQLite / PostgreSQL – for storing user data
bcrypt – for password hashing

Installation
git clone https://github.com/CodeEmmanuel-beep/JWT-FastAPI-project.git
cd JWT-FastAPI-project
pip install -r requirements.txt

Acknowledgments
This project was built as a hands-on way to learn FastAPI and JWT authentication. It’s my first real coding project — and I wrote over 800 lines of code in under a month. Still learning, still building. Thank you
